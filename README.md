This is a website project. This website is a cooking recepies blog.

The first objective is learn html, css. Maybe apply some JavaScript after. Second, I'd like to implement some backend with python, like the feature of login, 
so any user could upload the recipy he'd like, and a database for store all recepies and users. 

I'm doing this just for learning and could evolve to another format in any moment.
